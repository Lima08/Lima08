<br />

After working as a team supervisor for over eight years, I decided to change my carrier and throw myself into the software developer world. Since 2021 I've been studying and working with JavaScript, NodeJs, ReactJs, React Native, Vue, Stencil.js, GraphQL, TypeOrm, MySql, and other technologies.

In 2022 I started working as a full-stack developer, building an e-commerce Saas platform and delivering solutions such as payment gateways, CRM, ERP, and shipping services. Working in these remote Agile teams, I've experienced several areas of software development, such as front-end, back-end, mobile, architecture, and tests.

Throughout my career, I've already had the opportunity to participate in different kinds of projects and positions, such as multicultural music events producer, radio audience research, and now, building e-commerce solutions. I'm a solving problems guy that tries to bring ideas to reality.

I want to merge my teamwork experience with software developer knowledge to build solutions that positively impact people's lives. It is a meaningful goal in my career, and I'm all seeking it. My work is with people, processes, and mainly purpose!
