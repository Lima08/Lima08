### Hey there, I'm Lima!

<p>After eight years of leadership as a team supervisor, I embraced a pivotal career shift into software development in 2021. Since then, I've been working with a focus on Front End development.</p>

<p>In 2022, I ventured into the e-commerce industry, contributing to a SaaS platform by developing CRM and ERP solutions.</p>

<p>Today, I am driven by a mission to leverage my blend of teamwork and technical skills to develop solutions that have a meaningful impact on people's lives.</p>

<strong>My work is with people, processes, and mainly purpose!</strong>
